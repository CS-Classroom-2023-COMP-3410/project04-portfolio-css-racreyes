I chose a minimalist, nature-inspired theme for my design, focusing on greens, browns, and blacks to create a sleek and grounded appearance. Since nature is one of my greatest passions, I wanted the theme to reflect that without becoming overly cluttered. One of the main challenges I encountered was setting up the CSS framework and then executing the design within what felt like a very limited timeframe. However, this proved to be a valuable learning experience. To tackle these challenges, I relied on all available resources, including ChatGPT, though its utility was somewhat limited in this particular instance. When approaching responsiveness, I made sure the design stayed true to my initial vision, ensuring it not only maintained the essence of the theme but also appeared visually appealing on smaller screens.
