                During my time at Blizzard, I learned more than I ever thought possible.
                Not only about coding, but also about living alone in a new state, adapting
                to new driving habits, trying new foods, and meeting new people. I gained
                immense technical knowledge in software engineering and learned from senior
                developers. My primary task was to improve our internal system for sending
                builds out for testing. I accomplished this by automating processes using
                Jenkins, Google Cloud Functions, and AWS S3 buckets. I gained experience
                with GCP, Jenkins, and Groovy.

                  My internship at Lockheed Martin was a transformative experience, starting
                  right out of high school with little coding experience. Over three years,
                  I contributed to projects ranging from UI/UX development to innovative
                  firefighting solutions.
